## Overview

WifiDirect is an open source application that enables sharing of data between Android devices running Android 4.0 or higher using a WiFi direct connection without the use of a separate WiFi access point. As an alternative to Bluetooth, WifiDirect enables transfer of data between devices at much higher speeds without relying on any existing network infrastructure.
